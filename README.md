# AWS-Hack-Flood-Damage
## About
This project was made for AWS Disaster Response Hackathon. This repository contains code for identifying damaged regions in an aerial image. Identifying damaged objects (such as roads and buildings) in aerial images can be helpful to disaster-response organizations in responding to natural calamities faster and more efficiently. This project focuses on how organizations can respond better to damage inflicted by hurricanes and floods. The datasets used to train models contain aerial images of zones affected by hurricane Harvey.

## Functionality
The project is focused on the response phase of a disaster life cycle. It provides two basic functions. 
* **Road Connectivity: *Identify flooded and non-flooded roads.*** This can be useful for various tasks (transportation and mobility) such as planning a route to a particular location when some roads are inundated with water. It gives a basic overview of connectivity of roads which flooded and non-flooded. 
* **Damaged Regions: *Identify damaaged regions (broken houses or flooded parts).*** This can be useful to organization in estimating which areas in a town or city have been affected the most, thereby allowing them to properly direct their efforts. 
* **Basic Graphical User Interface.**</b> This allows users to upload their aerial images (from UAV or Satellite) and easily implement the above mentioned functions. More features can be implemented in the future.
