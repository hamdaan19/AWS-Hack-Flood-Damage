# AWS-Hack-Flood-Damage
## About
This project was made for AWS Disaster Response Hackathon. This repository contains code for identifying damaged regions in an aerial image. Identifying damaged objects (such as roads and buildings) in aerial images can be helpful to disaster-response organizations in responding to natural calamities faster and more efficiently. This project focuses on how organizations can respond better to damage inflicted by hurricanes and floods. The datasets used to train models contain aerial images of zones affected by hurricane Harvey.
