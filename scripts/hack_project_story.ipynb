    "## Inspiration\n",
    "Emergency Response Teams (ERT) heavily rely on real-time information during calamities and disasters. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have recently gained popularity in their deployment for aerial surrveillance as it provides a real-time bird's eye perspective of the crisis to ERTs. However, aerial imagery can provide overwhelming amounts of information which can make it difficult for First Responders to judge/estimate the regions most affected by calamity in a large area. Moreover, during floods caused by hurricanes/cyclones, when a portion of roads are inundated with water, it can be hard for ERTs to logistically manage the transportation of people and supplies and to plan safe routes to certain locations in a disaster affected area, with or without aerial imagery. Additionally, for ERTs to work and coordinate efficiently during a time of crisis, shared situational awareness and information is critical. In other words, one of the biggest things that hinder the cross-agency coordination of ERTs is the lack of standardized means of communication, information sharing and limited information itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address these pressing needs and to enhance the level of coordination of ERTs, we introduce Floodie which is an application that leverages aerial surveillance and helps response teams to work and communicate better thereby speeding up the recovery of a disaster affected area. The next section will focus on specific problems addressed by Floodie.   \n",
    "## What is Floodie\n",
    "Floodie is an application which uses Machine Learning techniques to leverage aerial imagery and produce useful information. This can be extremely beneficial to response teams to communicate better and function more efficiently. There are several ways in which disaster response teams can benefit from floodie. A few of the important ones are discussed in the following secton.    \n",
    "### Understanding Floodie\n",
    "This section will help you to understand Floodie better and what it's really about. \n",
    "#### Which natural calamity is Floodie designed to help with?\n",
    "Floodie is mainly focussed on calamities such as hurricanes and cyclones and the floods caused by them in coastal regions. However, future versions of Floodie can be expanded to help with other kinds of natural calamities.  \n",
    "#### How does Floodie logistically help ERTs plan routes and transport supplies in flooded areas?\n",
    "Floodie works by extracting useful information from aerial images. It can identify flooded and non-flooded roads in an aerial images and generate color-coded segmented maps of city roads. These maps can help to convey how flooded and non-flooded roads are connected and interlinked. These maps can be stitched together to provide Road-Connectivity information over large areas inside a city. This can greatly help ERTs to plan routes for transportation and carry out rescue operations. \n",
    "#### How does Floodie help ERTs identify affected zones in a large aerial image? \n",
    "Floodie also has the functionality of identifying affected (damaged/flooded) zones. It works by dividing a large aerial image into smaller 128x128 sized images and perform binary classification on them. The end result is a two-color-coded map representing affected (damaged) and unaffected (not damaged) zones. This coupled with the Road-Connectivity map can not only provide extremely useful information to response teams, but also help them direct their efforts to the most affected zones in a coastal city or a town. \n",
    "#### How does Floodie establish a standard of communication and information-sharing among ERTs? \n",
    "Color-coded maps generated by Floodie can easily be shared by ERTs to other ERTs operating in a different location. These maps can be augmented by adding markers, GPS points, notes, etc. and can therefore act as a template or a standard means of sharing information quickly and efficiently.  \n",
    "#### How does Floodie aid the recovery process of disaster-affected area? \n",
    "By providing ERTs the access to key information and enabling them to correctly direct their efforts, communicate better, gain situational awareness of a crisis and plan transportation routes, Floodie can undoutedly speed up the recovery process of a disaster-affected area.  \n",
    "## How we built it\n",
    "Floodie was built completely using Python 3 and Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab. Python 3 was used to write the backend code and develop a basic Graphical User Interface. Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab was used to train Machine Learning models with help of its GPU resources. The entire structure of Floodie can be divided into three parts namely,\n",

    "The GUI application was built using the Tkinter module of python\n",

    "## Challenges we ran into\n",
    "The main challenge in this project is to identify the flooded region of the path/road in the pile of data obtained through the aerial imagery and isolate them from the available path to manoeuvre the Emergency Response Team(ERT). At first, we couldn't develop a very accurate model with only a handful number of pictures available in the dataset. During the development of the building damage identifying module, we ran into several problems with its accuracy in prediction some of them are,\n",
    "- Since the dataset we used had only damaged/non-damaged buildings, we were not able to identify any other damages apart from buildings like roads, vegetation or agricultural land.\n",
    "- The images in the dataset also had a little bluish tint over them which caused a little bit of trouble in distinguishing the flood damages appropriately   \n",
    "To reduce the inaccuracy of the models,\n",
    "- The model was trained with additional epochs to boost its accuracy by a smaller margin\n",
    "- Instead of passing the whole image into the model, we divided the picture into smaller pieces of size 128px x 128px and tested the image and finally we combined every result together to provide useful information out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accomplishments that we're proud of\n",
    "After all the challenges and troubles that we faced during this project, we were really happy and proud to be able to successfully create a working prototype that fulfilled our primary problem statement. And also we learned from our mistakes to correct them but we didn't quit inbetween the project which in itself showed us our perseverence in completing this challenging yet fun project that encourages us to take up challenging projects like these more and more.\n",
    "## What we learned\n",
    "- First thing is that we were able to learn about the AWS-sagemaker studio labs relevance and ease of use in machine learning projects and it made our job easier than doing that in our local machine.\n",
    "- We were able to get insights into how the rescue mission teams work during a natural disaster and what are the difficulties they face in saving lives?\n",
    "- Finally, doing this project really helped us to learn more about the concepts we learned and try that out by making mistakes, understanding where we gone wrong and then finding a way to correct the issue, surely it will help us in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's next for Road connectivity during floods\n",
    "Floodie was able to identify the road connectivity and building damages due to floods and cyclones but still, there is more to it than simply identifying those things. As we know human beings could also be able to analyse and give the same inference by seeing an aerial image after floods.\n",
    "But imagine the days when robots and unmanned rescue vehicles would be utilised for these tasks that's when this project could become very useful as it will be easier for the machines to read the connectivity of roads by colour codes and which could be used to navigate them through those circumstances.\n"
